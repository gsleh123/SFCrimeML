## Welcome to SFCrimeML

This project is based on a project found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime). The goal of this project is to categorize crimes in SF based on certain fields found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data). We will be using a variety of ML algorithms such as logistic regression and gradient boosting. Our full project proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gHHNm9W-lBiU_dxJtWkVJIJlVXD2OCxYvNTxZrpglJs/edit?usp=sharing). This website will be used for keeping track of our progress.

### Blog Updates

*5/6/2018* - Working on using logistic regression to predict crime category. On the Kaggle competition, we scored a multiclass loss of 27.62709. This is just preliminary work with using ONLY logistic regression.

*5/7/2018* - Working on using xgboost to predict crime category. On the Kaggle competition, we scored a multiclass loss of 28. We believe the worse score is due to overfitting. We will work on tweaking the parameters to improve our score.


*5/16/2018* - Tuning the parameters (max_depth, min_child_weight, subsample, colsample_bytree, eta) just by a simple iteration and looking for the lowest merror.

*5/19/2018* - Improving the features.
